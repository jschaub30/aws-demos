Profile
Experienced Cloud Architect, with recent focus on AWS solution architecture and AI based cloud micro-services. Formerly at State Street Bank and IBM Research.

Experience
SOFTWARE CONSULTANT
Freelance
APRIL 2022 - PRESENT

• Deep dive on AWS: 5 certifcations incl. Solutions Architect Pro, SysOps Associate, Developer Associate.
• Maintained website, built registration, reporting and scheduling for the largest Suzuki summer music
institute in the world (https://issisuzuki.org/) for over 3 years, improving customer satisfaction and
enrollment each year.
• Completed courses in data structures/algorithms and distributed system design.
• Technologies: AWS, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, Lambda, Docker, Python, Bash, PHP

VP ARCHITECTURE DIRECTOR:AUTOMATION AND AI
State Street Corporation
JULY 2017 - APRIL 2022

• Architected, developed, deployed, and maintained production document conversion service using a
distributed architecture (Python/Kafka/Oracle/S3) to enable AI natural language processing pipelines.
• Developed automated unit, integration, and performance testing methodologies to enable robust,
reliable production service.
• Managed and scaled the document conversion service by >50X using agile development methods to
enable new features for expanding business needs. Planned sprints, managed stand-up meetings,
maintained Kanban board and executed all releases.
• Designed the cloud platform architecture for all production AI micro-services using 12-factor app
principles to optimize system scalability and performance. Deployed to on-premises clouds using
Kubernetes/docker as well as native (Redhat) linux.
• Created and continuously deployed self-service demo platform for cloud AI micro-services using
Kubernetes/Ansible/Openstack to develop pipeline of seed projects with various business units.
• Technologies: Kubernetes, Kafka, docker, Openstack, python, linux, shell, SQL, javascript, API design

RESEARCH STAFF MEMBER
IBM Austin Research Lab
JULY 2004 - JULY 2017

• Played a pivotal role in managing top-level sort and networking code across 512 servers in order to win
the 2016 Sort Benchmark Competition (https://sortbenchmark.org/) securing records in four categories
with a performance improvement of 2.8-5.0X over previous results. These world records still stand.
• Spearheaded the creation of advanced data visualization tools using linux shell and html/javascript in
order to optimize system performance for multi-node big data and cognitive workloads.
• Led the design of specialized macros for testing high-speed L1 and L2 SRAM memory in Power7/8
superscalar processors in order to advance IBM's semiconductor capabilities.
• Designed and patented an implementation of the spiral cache, an innovative self-organizing cache
system that minimizes access latency for frequently accessed values, achieving optimized
performance with reduced space and power consumption via k-dimensional spiral structures.
• Designed and tested high-performance phase-locked loops (PLLs) using interpolative oscillators,
achieving clock frequencies up to 24.6 GHz, across 65-180nm CMOS, demonstrating robust clock
generation for advanced digital architectures.
• Technologies: shell scripting, linux, Ansible, python, R, Javascript, circuit design

RESEARCH STAFF MEMBER
IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center

SEPTEMBER 2000 - JULY 2004

• Led high-speed characterization of optical communication links on Terabus project, a chip-to-chip
parallel optical interconnect, achieving 14 Gb/s per channel and an aggregate throughput of 672
Gb/s for high performance server applications.
• Built a custom testing station that achieved 120-Gb/s (12 x 10Gb/s) to exercise parallel optical links,
achieving the highest throughput by 4X at a fraction of the cost compared to state of the art.
• Developed high-speed Ge-on-SOI photodetectors achieving up to 29 GHz bandwidth, with design
optimizations for enhanced ef ciency and speed, supporting applications in integrated optical
interconnects at key wavelengths.
• Pioneered advancements in silicon-based photodetectors, including the record fastest CMOS
photodetector at 13.9 Gb/s, and a >15 GHz pure germanium photodiode on silicon, supporting
high-speed, cost-effective optical interconnects for next-generation server applications.
